> To setup and types of request please go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/omkarnath1123/Spider-REST-API/wiki) page.

## Test API
- proceed to client site of spider(as link mention above in Client Site Rendering) and as you are a new user click on sign up now.
- open page console `Ctrl Shift J` (on Windows) or `Ctrl Option J` (on Mac) and clear your console
- now fill your desired _USERNAME_, _EMAIL_ and _PASSWORD_ and click sign up.
- If you see something like this object in your console you have just created a user for api request. If not sign up again and select a new user name. Even after that you are still facing issues please raise a issue.
```
{
  message: "New user is created successfully"
  success: true
}
```
- To receive a token from the user you have just created fill your _USERNAME_ and _PASSWORD_ and if your user name and password is correct you will see this object in your console which will contain your token.
```
{
    "loggedIn": true,
    "token": "fc16aabb57febca9af7ee886cb7f8c7e6d4aa4a4eb63c720be6d3bada157063761f2709e13d0010920e088f0af16070b4515c4774adb07a6cfa4966cf8bd69c141c51f9c5e286764497e90c64e5033629d64f84ae73a170ceab62407985a2be7a78114ebcecf0742e3d711765c8ec53aea5c83c8eb27ee0dcf1964762103aae44a85"
}
```
> remember copy token string without this => *"*  
- copy your token from console and now finally we hit the api using *CURL* request.
- place your token in the curl request and your curl request should look like this :

``curl --header "Authorization: <YOUR TOKEN HERE> "  -v https://spider-rest-api.herokuapp.com/Brand/SAMSUNG``
- open your terminal and paste you curl request and hopefully you will see the response as no of gadgets of SAMSUNG released till this date. This DB is not updated regurarly so device count may be little less.
```
{
    "success": true,
    "response": [
        {
            "company": "SAMSUNG",
            "no_of_devices": 1174
        }
    ]
}
```
